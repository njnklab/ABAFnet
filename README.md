# ISFARNet
A Novel Integrated Speech Feature Attention-based Recurrent Network Approach for Efficient Depression Detection and Analysis

---

## 📌 Introduction
<div style="color:blue;font-size:14px;">This repository contains the implementation of our proposed ISFARNet, a novel integrated speech feature attention-based recurrent network for efficient depression detection and analysis. The main goal of this project is to provide an accurate and efficient approach for detecting depression using speech data.</div>

<div style="color:grey;font-size:12px;">The code we released is not fully final in some details, some parts are debug versions of the code. Due to our concern about data privacy, we have hidden the loading part about the data, please contact us by email if you need.</div>

<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">test.py is the code for image features.</div>
<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">HSFs.py is the code for num vector features.</div>
<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">opensmile.py is the code for using opensmile tool.</div>
<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">pre.py is the code for extracting image features.</div>
<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">fusion.py is the code for fusion model.</div>
<div style="color:black;font-size:12px;">compare.py is the code for model performance comparation.</div>
