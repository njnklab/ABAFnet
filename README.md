## 📙 Dataset Application

Our research group will work on multi-population, multi-modal big-dataset acquisition and artificial intelligence methods.

For audio/video related data and research, please stay tuned to this code repository.

## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of our proposed **ABAFnet**, a novel integrated speech feature attention-based recurrent network for efficient depression detection and analysis. The main goal of this project is to provide an accurate and efficient approach for detecting depression using speech data.

_**Note:** The code we released is not compelete in some detail due to the data privacy, but the model structure parts are Complete Edition. For our concern about data privacy, we have hidden the part about the data._

## 💡 Features
- Feature extraction from speech data.
- Attention mechanism for better feature representation.
- Recurrent network architecture for modeling temporal information.
- Efficient and accurate depression detection.

## 🛠️ Installation and Usage
**Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xuxiaoooo/ABAFnet.git
cd ABAFnet
```
