# ISFARNet
A Novel Integrated Speech Feature Attention-based Recurrent Network Approach for Efficient Depression Detection and Analysis

---

## 📌 Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of our proposed **ISFARNet**, a novel integrated speech feature attention-based recurrent network for efficient depression detection and analysis. The main goal of this project is to provide an accurate and efficient approach for detecting depression using speech data.

_**Note:** The code we released is not fully final in some details, some parts are debug versions of the code. Due to our concern about data privacy, we have hidden the loading part about the data, please contact us by email if you need._

- `test.py` is the code for image features.
- `HSFs.py` is the code for num vector features.
- `opensmile.py` is the code for using opensmile tool.
- `pre.py` is the code for extracting image features.
- `fusion.py` is the code for fusion model.
- `compare.py` is the code for model performance comparation.

## 💡 Features
- Feature extraction from speech data.
- Attention mechanism for better feature representation.
- Recurrent network architecture for modeling temporal information.
- Efficient and accurate depression detection.
